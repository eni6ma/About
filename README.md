## Cyber Security Overview
In today's digital world, security is paramount.  This is especially true when it comes to verifying the identities of users and the authenticity of data. This paper explores the critical concepts of authentication and verification, untangling their differences and highlighting their roles in cybersecurity. We will delve into the various methods employed to achieve these goals, examining how users prove who they are and how data integrity is ensured. From widely used passwords to cutting-edge biometrics, we'll explore the factors that underpin authentication protocols. We'll also dissect the secure storage and management of user secrets, a cornerstone of robust authentication systems. By understanding these concepts, we can navigate the digital landscape with greater confidence and security.   [READ MORE](CyberSecurity.Overview.md) 


## Quantum Cryptanalysis

Despite the remarkable theoretical potential of quantum computing for cryptanalysis, its practical application remains largely theoretical and confined to experimental physics. The current technological state does not support the sensationalized claims of imminent threats to existing cryptographic systems. It is crucial for both the scientific community and the public to maintain a balanced perspective on the capabilities and limitations of quantum computers, steering clear of the pitfalls of hype and misinformation. Looking forward, continued research and development are vital to bridge the gap between the theoretical potential and practical application of quantum cryptanalysis, ensuring preparedness for future advancements in quantum computing.

## The Cost of Quantum Computing

Quantum computing emerges as a pioneering force in the landscape of technological innovation, poised to revolutionize a spectrum of industries spanning from healthcare to finance. Despite the allure of sensational headlines underscoring their potential, the journey toward realizing the full capabilities of quantum computers is fraught with formidable challenges. This comprehensive exploration endeavors to shed light on the formidable investments requisite for both the development and operation of quantum computing systems.

## Secure By Design

The Rosario Proof system and Cypher are new cryptographic tools designed to work without relying on electronic devices. This makes them suitable for various environments, including mobile devices, computers, and even isolated systems with no internet connection. The system is built with "Secure by Design" in mind, where security features are integrated from the beginning. The document argues that strong security requires a layered approach. It emphasizes the importance of building security on a foundation of cryptographic primitives like hash functions and digital signatures. These primitives are then used to create more complex security patterns such as access control and digital identities. Finally, the paper explores various security concepts in detail. These include how systems determine who has access (authority), how data history is tracked (provenance), and how to ensure actions cannot be denied (non-repudiation). It also explains how common security patterns like digital signatures and blockchain technology are used to implement these concepts. [READ MORE](Secure.By.Design.md)

## Quantum Attacks on Contemporary Cyphers

The best method known for solving languages in NP deterministically uses exponential time. (Remember, computers are deterministic by their very nature.) NP $i$ (exponential time) defined as :

$$
\bigcup_{k}=\tau\left(2 n^{k}\right)
$$

Exponential time algorithms typically arise when we solve problems by exhaustively searching through a space of solutions, called brute-force search. Ideally the language of any cryptographic scheme forces NP $i$ computation upon any Turing machine.

### Table 1: Complexity and Key Space Analysis for Grover's Algorithm

Limitations of Grover's Algorithm for AES-256 Attack:

1. Theoretical speedup is substantial but still requires an unfeasible number of operations $\left(2^{128}\right)$ for AES-256.

2. Quantum operations per second required $\left(10^{31}\right)$ far exceed current and near-future capabilities.

3. Quantum computer with hundreds of stable, error-corrected qubits is necessary, posing a significant technological challenge.
